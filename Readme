# DataManage project

Description:
Load data from different datasources (excel, sql, etc), transform it according to rules and save to model files

## DataManage structure:

### 1. Class `ModelManager` 
Main class to work with `models`: excel files with settings and list of variables to load and to transform. 

Has following methods:

1.  **constructor**
inputs: file path to the model
outputs: None
function: 
- initialize logger
- load YAML file with model settings, including main data fields and implemented string constants
- initialize basic class attributes. These are:
    - SourceTypeManagerMap - a mapping between codified source types mentioned in model "input" file and classes that treat abovementioned source types
    - model_output_sheets  - a dictionary that maps output_sheet to set of [already transformed] timeseries that are to be places on that sheet. This attribute
	is being filled on self.initialize_model_schema method
    - database_sources - a multi-key mapping that between full definition of data source and corresponding data-loading instance
    - variables - a list of Variable instances. Each instance corresponds to unique set of InputInfoCols values.
    - properly_defined_variables - a sublist of variables list that stores variables such that 1) Their raw ts is located and imported (stored within variable container)
	and 2) their properties are fully defined, which means that a data-loading instance was able to find nonempty information on its type, frequency, and 'calc' info
	field
    - undefined_variables_with_ts - a sublist of variables list that stores variables such that their raw ts is located and imported (stored within variable container)
    - undefined_variables - a sublist of variables list that stores variables such that there is no ts for them, so nothing can be done to those
    - variable_transformation_statuses - a list of dictionaries; Entries of this list originate at self.transform_variables. Each entry stores 1) an instance of variable
	class and 2) destination status - boolean flag indicating if destination (output_sheet key) transformartion went well

containing a transformation method itself, a list of rdp fields needed to call this method, a list of tif fields needed to call this method, TODO - a change_name 
key that should contain logic of time series name transformation.
